## Calabash Driver
The *calabash-driver* offers a java api to write end-to-end tests for Android using the [calabash-android project](http://github.com/calabash/calabash-android).
The [Selenium Grid](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2) can be used for scaling and parallel testing.

# Current State

Please note that calabash-driver doesn't support the version 4.* of calabash-android and that there are no plans to implement this support.
